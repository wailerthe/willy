  <h1>About us</h1>
  <h2 style="color:blue"><i>WELCOME TO MATATU CULTURE</i></h2>
  <h1>Matwana Matatu Culture seeks to Promote, Preserve
& Showcase the Matatu industry. We Celebrate this
Means of Transport through Art, Music, People &
Culture. Our main focus is to Re-brand and Build
value in the Matatu Industry.</h1>
  <h1>The Matatu Industry is not only one of the biggest
informal sectors in Kenya but also the main means
of getting people from one point to the other.
Matatus are easily found in reasonably sized cities
and towns that have plenty of services covering
every major road and suburb ready to serve millions
of people everyday.</h1>
<h1>The use of Matatus in Kenya started in the early
 1950’s. After Kenya gained independence in 1963,
there was a major rural-urban migration in search of
employment. The people then were too poor to
afford daily transport to and from the cities
prompting mini-bus taxis to start offering this
service at a cost. They gradually increased due to
the lucrative nature of the business and continued
increase in urban population. The Matatu industry
however started off as a pirate. It was an illegal
commercial entity. In 1973, Kenya’s founding
president, Jomo Kenyatta issued a decree
recognising Matatus as a legal form of transport.
Initially, they were operating on an illegal basis.
Even so, they did not require a Transport Licensing
Board (TLB) and Public Service Vehicle (PSV)
licensing. According to Kenyatta, they were a
blessing to the Kenyan economy as they created
jobs and the Matatu operators were hardworking
Kenyans who contributed to the growth of a young
republic. Later, the exchequer discovered the
millions that lay in the industry in terms of revenue
and introduced the PSV Licensing.</h1>

<h1>Matatus form part of Kenya’s rich cultural fabric and
pop culture. The artwork and graffiti displayed on
Matatus are usually used as a form of
communication and a way to create awareness in a
wide number of topics from political issues, trends,
fashion designers, public figures from local and
international entertainment industries, the infamous,
religious themes, African heritage, football themes
and so much more. Music systems in terms of
audio and visuals are also up to date with state of
the art brands and technology including CCTV
cameras for security purposes </h1
